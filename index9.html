            <h1>GT vs PBKS key match highlights: What happened during IPL 2025 match in Ahmedabad yesterday?</h1>
            <p class="date">Published on: March 25, 2025</p>

            <p>Shreyas Iyer once again showcased his class with a well-guided and selfless unbeaten half-century as Punjab Kings defeated Gujarat Titans by 11 runs in the IPL 2025 match on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>A stunning half-century by star batter Shreyas Iyer, supported by powerful knocks of debutant Priyansh Arya and Shashank Singh, guided Punjab Kings (PBKS) to a nail-biting 11 runs win over Gujarat Titans in the IPL 2025 on Tuesday at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium.</p>
            <p>On a pitch which has favoured the batters, Shubman Gill won the toss and sent the guests to bat first. Skipper Shreyas Iyer made a wonderful 97, supported by Priyansh Arya (47) and Shashank Singh (44).</p>
            <p>Shashank Singh and Shreyas Iyer set an 81-run partnership for the sixth wicket, Punjab King's highest wicket in IPL. This partnership breached the previous record of 73 runs between Sam Curran and Shahrukh Khan. This helped PBKS score a massive target of 243/5 against Gujarat Titans.

            </p>
            <h2>Shreyas Iyer's captain knock:</h2>
            <p>Leading Punjab Kings for the first match in the Indian Premier League 2025, Shreyas Iyer bludgeoned an unbeaten 42-ball 97 runs, which included as many as nine sixes and five fours at an astounding strike rate of 230.95.

                After coming to bat at number 3 for Punjab Kings, Iyer shared a couple of blistering stands with debutant Priyansh Arora, Marcus Stoinis and Shashank Singh.</p>
                <p>Earlier, Iyer shared a 51-run stand-off in just 21 deliveries and 57-run partnership in 28 deliveries with Marcus Stoinis.

                    Though it was expected that Iyer would complete his century, Shashank went berserk and stayed unbeaten on 44 in 16 balls, with Iyer stranded on 97 at the non-striker's end.</p>
