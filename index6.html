            <p>Nirmala Sitharaman said that out of 19,501 taxpayers, a total of 11,162 taxpayers revised their returns and filled out Schedule Foreign Assets Form, declaring total assets of ₹11,259.29 crores and disclosing foreign income of ₹154.42 crore.</p>
            <p>More than 30,000 taxpayers have declared foreign assets and income worth about ₹30,300 crore by filing revised income tax returns (ITRs) or belated returns under the ‘nudge’ campaign, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Tuesday.

                “We carried out a ‘nudge’ campaign in which we encouraged taxpayers to voluntarily disclose their foreign income and assets. SMS and emails were sent to around 19,501 selected taxpayers, asking them to review their income tax returns filed for 2024-25 based on information available to the Income Tax Department regarding foreign deposits,” Sitharaman announced in the Lok Sabha.</p>
            <p>Out of 19,501 taxpayers, a total of 11,162 revised their returns and filled out the Schedule Foreign Assets form, declaring total assets worth ₹11,259.29 crore and disclosing foreign income of ₹154.42 crore, she added.

                The finance minister also stated that 883 taxpayers corrected their status from resident to non-resident in their revised income tax returns (ITRs) for the assessment year (AY) 2024-25.
                
                Additionally, 13,516 taxpayers declared foreign assets worth ₹7,564 crore and foreign income of around ₹353 crore in their revised ITRs for 2024-25.</p>
                <h2>‘Ripple Effect’</h2>
            <p>Due to the campaign, there was a “ripple effect”, she said.

                “Cumulatively, this simple nudge resulted in the declaration of foreign assets worth ₹29,208 crore and foreign income of ₹1,089 crore ( ₹30,297 crore) in Schedule FA (foreign assets) by 30,161 taxpayers,” the finance minister said.</p>
            <p>She further said that the nudge campaign on overseas property holdings has yielded positive results, with taxpayers disclosing their assets and paying the dues owed.</p>
